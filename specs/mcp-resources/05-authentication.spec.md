# Authentication Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication approach for the MCP server, which will provide open, public access to component documentation.

## Authentication Approach

After careful consideration, we've decided to make our MCP server publicly accessible without authentication requirements. This approach aligns with our goals of:

1. **Maximum Accessibility** - Allowing all AI assistants, tools, and developers to easily access component documentation
2. **Simplified Integration** - Removing authentication barriers for external consumers
3. **Open Documentation** - Treating our component documentation as a public resource for the community

## Public Access Implementation

Our extended m-yoshiro/storybook-mcp implementation will:

1. **Remove Authentication Requirements**
   - No API keys or authentication tokens required
   - All endpoints accessible via simple HTTP requests
   - No rate limiting based on identity

2. **MCP Protocol Integration**
   - Maintain standard MCP protocol behavior
   - No authentication metadata in MCP server responses
   - Full public access to all MCP tools and endpoints

## Security Considerations

While authentication is not required, we still maintain security best practices:

1. **Read-Only API**
   - All endpoints are read-only
   - No modification of component documentation is possible via the API

2. **Transport Security**
   - All API traffic uses HTTPS to ensure data integrity
   - Modern TLS protocols enforced

3. **Monitoring**
   - Traffic patterns monitored for abuse
   - Optional rate limiting based on IP address to prevent DoS attacks

## Integration with Consuming Applications

AI assistants and other applications will integrate with the public MCP server by:

1. Making direct HTTP requests to the MCP server endpoints
2. No authentication credentials needed
3. Following standard MCP client implementation patterns

## Future Considerations

If authentication requirements change in the future, we can implement:

1. Optional authentication for premium features
2. Rate limiting for anonymous access
3. API key registration for analytics purposes

However, the core documentation will remain publicly accessible.

## Example Request Flow

1. AI assistant makes request to MCP server:
   ```
   GET /api/mcp/v1/components
   ```
2. Server processes the request without authentication checks
3. Component data is returned directly to the client
