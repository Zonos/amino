# MCP Server Implementation - Phase 1 (MVP)

## Overview

This document outlines the minimal viable product (MVP) implementation plan for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Phase 1 focuses on delivering core functionality with the minimum necessary components to provide immediate value while deferring more complex features to later phases.

## Phase 1 Goals

1. Create a functional MCP server that can extract and serve basic component documentation
2. Focus exclusively on JSDoc comment extraction for the initial implementation
3. Provide essential API endpoints for component listing and details
4. Establish the foundation for future enhancements

## Core Components for Phase 1

### 1. JSDoc Comment Extractor

- Extract component descriptions and basic metadata from JSDoc comments
- Parse basic JSDoc tags (especially @param, @default, and @example)
- Associate comments with components and props
- Handle minimal markdown formatting

### 2. Basic JSON File Structure

- Create a simple flat structure for storing component documentation
- Generate an index file listing all components
- Create individual component files with extracted documentation
- Minimal organization without complex categorization

### 3. Essential API Endpoints

- Component listing endpoint (`/api/components`)
- Component detail endpoint (`/api/components/:id`)
- Basic health check endpoint (`/api/health`)

### 4. Core MCP Protocol Support

- Implement the minimum required MCP tools:
  - `list-components` tool
  - `find-component-by-name` tool (basic implementation)
  - `get-component-details` tool

### 5. Build Integration

- Add basic integration with the build process
- Configure minimal extraction options
- Set up logging for the extraction process

## Features Deferred to Later Phases

1. TypeScript interface parsing and type extraction
2. Enhanced example extraction and rendering
3. Search functionality and index generation
4. Advanced categorization and organization
5. Performance optimizations and caching
6. Advanced MCP protocol tools
7. Comprehensive monitoring and error reporting
8. Production deployment configurations

## Implementation Sequence

1. Implement the component discovery module
2. Create the JSDoc comment extractor
3. Develop the basic JSON file generator
4. Implement essential API endpoints
5. Add core MCP protocol tool support
6. Integrate with the build process
7. Set up basic testing and validation

## Success Criteria

The Phase 1 implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The extractor can successfully process JSDoc comments from Amino components
2. The API can serve component listings and component details
3. The MCP protocol tools can be used to retrieve component information
4. The extraction process is integrated with the build pipeline

## Next Steps After Phase 1

After completing Phase 1, we will gather feedback on the initial implementation and plan for Phase 2, which will focus on enhancing the documentation quality with TypeScript interface parsing and improved example extraction.
