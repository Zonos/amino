# Deployment Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the deployment approach for the MCP server, based on our selected MCP tool (m-yoshiro/storybook-mcp) with custom extensions. The deployment is designed to leverage Vercel's serverless architecture while maintaining high performance and reliability.

## Deployment Strategy Rationale

We've selected a deployment strategy that builds upon the static file approach of m-yoshiro/storybook-mcp while leveraging Vercel's serverless functions for API routes. This hybrid approach provides:

1. Fast access to static documentation via CDN
2. Scalable API endpoints for dynamic operations
3. Simple integration with our existing CI/CD pipelines

## Deployment Components

### 1. Documentation Generation

**Process:**
- Documentation is extracted during the Storybook build process
- Static JSON files are generated and included in the build output
- Files are organized according to our documentation format specification

**Integration with m-yoshiro/storybook-mcp:**
- We extend the base m-yoshiro/storybook-mcp implementation to support our enhanced documentation format
- Custom extractors run as pre-build steps to generate the documentation
- The output matches the expected format for the MCP server

### 2. Vercel Deployment

**Configuration:**
- Vercel project configured to deploy both static files and API routes
- Custom build script to run documentation extraction
- Environment variables for configuration settings

**API Routes:**
- Implemented as serverless functions
- Map directly to the MCP protocol endpoints
- Access static JSON files to serve documentation

**Static Files:**
- JSON documentation files served via Vercel's CDN
- Optimized for fast global access

## Integration with m-yoshiro/storybook-mcp

Our deployment uses m-yoshiro/storybook-mcp as a dependency with the following extensions:

1. **Enhanced Static Files**
   - Richer documentation format with TypeScript interfaces and examples
   - Organized file structure for efficient access

2. **MCP Protocol Implementation**
   - Complete implementation of MCP protocol via TypeScript-based API routes
   - Extended tool set beyond basic listing and search

3. **Integration with build-utils**
   - Documentation extractor implemented in the build-utils/mcp directory
   - Seamless integration with our existing build process

## CI/CD Pipeline

The deployment process is fully automated through our CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Build Stage**
   - Clone repository
   - Install dependencies
   - Extract documentation from component files
   - Build Storybook with documentation included
   - Generate static JSON files

2. **Test Stage**
   - Validate documentation format
   - Test API routes with mock requests

3. **Deploy Stage**
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Run smoke tests against deployed endpoints
   - Update monitoring configurations

## Monitoring and Maintenance

The deployed MCP server will be monitored for:

1. **Performance**
   - Response time metrics for API endpoints
   - Cache hit ratios for static files

2. **Errors**
   - API error rates
   - Missing documentation warnings

3. **Usage**
   - Request volumes by endpoint
   - Unique consumers
   - Most accessed components

## Deployment Environments

The MCP server will have multiple deployment environments:

1. **Development**
   - Automatically deployed from feature branches
   - Used for testing new features
   - Accessible only to internal developers

2. **Staging**
   - Deployed from the main branch
   - Used for pre-production validation
   - Accessible to internal teams and selected partners

3. **Production**
   - Deployed from release tags
   - Accessible to authorized consumers
   - Backed by SLAs for uptime and performance

## Disaster Recovery

The disaster recovery plan includes:

1. **Backup Strategy**
   - Regular backups of configuration and environment variables
   - Documentation source files backed up in version control

2. **Recovery Procedures**
   - Documented steps for rebuilding and redeploying
   - Rollback procedures for failed deployments

3. **Failover Mechanisms**
   - Leverages Vercel's multi-region deployment
   - Automatic failover for API routes

## Resource Requirements

The deployment has the following resource requirements:

1. **Build Resources**
   - Memory: 4GB minimum for documentation extraction
   - Storage: 1GB for build artifacts

2. **Runtime Resources**
   - CPU: Minimal (handled by Vercel serverless)
   - Memory: Minimal (handled by Vercel serverless)
   - Storage: ~100MB for static JSON files

3. **Network**
   - Bandwidth: ~10GB/month for typical usage
   - Requests: Up to 100,000 requests per day

## Rollout Plan

The initial rollout will follow these steps:

1. Deploy to development environment for internal testing
2. Conduct performance and security testing
3. Deploy to staging for partner testing
4. Gradually roll out to production with selected consumers
5. Monitor and optimize based on real-world usage
6. Open access to all authorized consumers
