# API Routes Implementation Prompt

## Background
We've successfully integrated the documentation extraction into our build process. Now we need to create API routes to serve this documentation to MCP clients.

## Task Description
We need to implement the following API routes for our MCP server:

1. Base API route structure and organization
2. Components listing endpoint with filtering and pagination
3. Component details endpoint for specific component information
4. Search endpoint for discovering components
5. Categories endpoints for grouping components
6. Health check endpoint for monitoring

## Technical Requirements
- API responses should be fast (under 100ms)
- Routes should follow RESTful conventions
- Endpoints should include proper error handling
- Search should be efficient and support fuzzy matching
- All endpoints should be properly typed and documented

## Implementation Guidance

### API Architecture for Fast Responses
- Implement file-based API routes using a static asset serving strategy
- Cache JSON files in memory during server initialization for faster responses
- Use streaming responses for large payloads to improve time-to-first-byte
- Implement HTTP/2 support for concurrent requests
- Add appropriate cache headers (ETag, Last-Modified) for client-side caching
- Create a data access layer that abstracts file operations from API controllers

### Pagination and Filtering Implementation
- Implement cursor-based pagination for better performance with large datasets
- Support filtering via query parameters with a standardized parameter structure
- Create a reusable pagination utility that handles offset calculations
- Implement field selection to allow clients to request only needed fields
- Add sorting options with configurable sort fields and directions
- Implement response metadata with pagination details and available filters

### Search Implementation Strategy
- Use the pre-built search index from the build process for optimal performance
- Implement a multi-stage search pipeline that prioritizes exact matches first
- Add prefix matching for autocomplete functionality
- Use a configurable relevance scoring system based on field weights
- Implement fuzzy matching with Levenshtein distance for typo tolerance
- Cache frequent search queries for improved response times

### Component Categorization Structure
- Organize components into primary categories based on their function:
  - Layout components (Grid, Stack, Flex)
  - Input components (Form fields, Selects, Buttons)
  - Display components (Cards, Lists, Tables)
  - Feedback components (Toasts, Alerts, Progress indicators)
  - Navigation components (Tabs, Menus, Breadcrumbs)
- Support hierarchical categories with parent-child relationships
- Allow components to belong to multiple categories
- Include metadata about category relationships and hierarchies
- Provide endpoints for category-based browsing

### Monitoring and Health Checks
- Implement a comprehensive health check endpoint that validates:
  - Documentation data availability and integrity
  - Search index status
  - Server resource metrics
- Add structured logging for all API requests with timing information
- Implement a status endpoint that reports build version and timestamp
- Create error rate tracking for failed requests
- Add performance monitoring for endpoint response times
- Include documentation coverage metrics in health reporting

## Current Environment
- We have static JSON files in `public/mcp-docs/`
- We can use any server technology (Express, Next.js API routes, etc.)
- Components are categorized by their type and functionality
- Documentation is pre-generated during the build

## Expected Outcome
Provide detailed implementation strategies for:
1. Base API route structure and organization
2. Components listing endpoint implementation
3. Component details endpoint implementation
4. Search endpoint implementation
5. Categories endpoint implementation
6. Health check endpoint implementation

Include code examples for the key API endpoints and explain how to test them.
