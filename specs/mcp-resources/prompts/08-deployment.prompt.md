# Deployment Prompt

## Background
We've implemented and thoroughly tested our MCP server. Now we need to create a deployment strategy to make it available in production.

## Task Description
We need to implement a deployment plan for our MCP server implementation, including:

1. Production environment setup
2. Build and deployment pipeline
3. Caching and CDN configuration
4. Monitoring and alerting
5. Performance optimization

## Technical Requirements
- The deployment should be reliable and scalable
- CI/CD pipeline should automatically build and deploy changes
- Performance should be optimized for global access
- Monitoring should detect any issues with the service
- Rollback procedures should be in place

## Implementation Guidance

### Hosting Solution Architecture
- Deploy the MCP server as a serverless function on AWS Lambda for optimal scaling
- Use API Gateway to manage API requests, rate limiting, and authentication
- Store static JSON documentation files in S3 buckets for cost-effective storage
- Implement regional replications for global performance optimization
- Use CloudFront distribution for global edge caching
- Implement Lambda@Edge functions for customized CDN behavior
- Deploy with infrastructure as code using AWS CDK or Terraform

### Caching Strategy Implementation
- Configure a multi-layered caching strategy:
  - Browser-level caching with appropriate Cache-Control headers
  - CDN edge caching for static documentation files
  - API response caching with configurable TTL based on content type
  - Server-side caching for database queries and expensive operations
- Implement cache invalidation through versioned URLs
- Add ETag and conditional request support for efficient updates
- Configure different cache settings for different resource types:
  - Long TTL for stable documentation (1 week)
  - Medium TTL for component listings (1 day)
  - Short TTL for search indices (1 hour)
  - No cache for health check endpoints

### Monitoring and Metrics Configuration
- Implement comprehensive monitoring across all system layers:
  - API endpoint metrics: requests, latency, errors
  - Lambda execution metrics: duration, memory utilization, throttling
  - CDN metrics: cache hit ratio, origin requests, bandwidth
  - S3 metrics: requests, bandwidth, errors
- Create custom DataDog dashboards showing:
  - Overall service health
  - Performance metrics over time
  - Request patterns and geographic distribution
  - Error rates and types
- Configure alerting for:
  - High error rates (>1%)
  - Elevated response times (>200ms p95)
  - Unusual traffic patterns
  - Cache miss spikes
  - Infrastructure quota limits approaching

### Versioning and Rollback Strategy
- Implement Blue/Green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
- Create a versioned deployment system with explicit version identifiers
- Store previous documentation versions in separate directories
- Use feature flags to control rollout of major changes
- Implement automated rollback triggers based on error rates
- Create immutable deployments with complete environment snapshots
- Maintain detailed deployment history with change tracking
- Implement automatic canary testing before full deployment

## Current Environment
- Our main application is hosted on AWS
- We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- We use DataDog for monitoring
- Our CDN is Cloudflare

## Expected Outcome
Provide detailed implementation strategies for:
1. Production environment configuration
2. CI/CD pipeline setup
3. Caching and CDN configuration
4. Monitoring and alerting implementation

Include specific configuration examples and explain the rationale for key decisions.
