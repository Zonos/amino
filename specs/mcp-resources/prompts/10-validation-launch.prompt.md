# Validation and Launch Prompt

## Background
We've implemented, tested, documented, and deployed our MCP server. Now we need to perform final validation and prepare for launch.

## Task Description
We need to implement a final validation and launch plan for our MCP server, including:

1. Final validation checklist
2. Launch strategy
3. Post-launch monitoring
4. Feedback collection and iteration plan

## Technical Requirements
- All critical functionality must be validated before launch
- Launch should be controlled and monitored
- Post-launch monitoring should detect any issues quickly
- Feedback should be collected and incorporated systematically

## Implementation Guidance

### Launch Readiness Criteria
- Implement a comprehensive launch readiness assessment including:
  - Code quality metrics: >90% test coverage for critical paths
  - Performance benchmarks: <100ms API response times for all endpoints
  - Documentation completeness: 100% API coverage
  - Security assessment: Passing all security tests
  - Accessibility compliance: WCAG AA standards met
  - Cross-browser compatibility: Verified in all target browsers
  - Load testing validation: Handling 10x expected traffic
  - Error rate baseline: <0.1% error rate in pre-production
  - Integration testing: Verified with all target AI assistants
- Create a formal sign-off process with stakeholder approvals
- Develop a launch blockers tracking system with severity classification
- Implement a pre-launch simulation with synthetic traffic

### Phased Launch Strategy
- Implement a controlled rollout using the following phases:
  1. Internal Developer Preview (1-2 weeks)
     - Limited to internal developers
     - Focus on collecting early feedback
     - Daily check-ins and rapid iteration
  2. Alpha Release (2-3 weeks)
     - Selected external partners
     - Structured testing scenarios
     - Focus on integration validation
  3. Beta Release (3-4 weeks)
     - Expanded partner access
     - Real-world usage monitoring
     - Focus on performance and scalability
  4. Limited Production (2 weeks)
     - Percentage-based rollout (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
     - Automated health checking with rollback triggers
     - Controlled traffic ramp-up
  5. General Availability
     - Full public launch
     - Marketing and announcement coordination
     - Support team readiness
- Implement feature flags to control feature availability during rollout
- Create detailed rollback procedures for each phase

### Key Monitoring Metrics
- Implement comprehensive monitoring focusing on:
  - API Health: Requests, latency (p50, p95, p99), error rates by endpoint
  - System Resources: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
  - Client Experience: Time to first meaningful response, success rate
  - Business Metrics: Active users, component usage distribution
  - Integration Metrics: AI assistant usage patterns, component discovery rate
  - Error Patterns: Classification and trend analysis of errors
- Create real-time dashboards with alerting thresholds
- Implement anomaly detection for unexpected behavior
- Set up on-call rotation with incident response procedures
- Create post-incident review process for continuous improvement

### Feedback Collection Framework
- Implement multi-channel feedback collection:
  - Direct user feedback via in-product feedback forms
  - Developer feedback through GitHub issues and discussion
  - AI assistant integration feedback via telemetry
  - Support ticket analysis and categorization
  - Usage pattern analysis to identify friction points
- Create a feedback prioritization framework
  - Impact assessment matrix (user impact vs. implementation effort)
  - Severity classification for issues
  - Feature request voting system
- Implement regular feedback review cycles with product team
- Establish update cadence for incorporating feedback
- Create public roadmap to communicate planned improvements
