# End-to-End Testing Prompt

## Background
We have implemented our MCP server with comprehensive unit and integration tests. Now we need to validate the whole system through end-to-end testing with real AI assistants.

## Task Description
We need to implement end-to-end testing for our MCP server implementation, including:

1. Testing with AI assistant MCP clients
2. Testing with real component changes
3. Validation against performance requirements
4. Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Technical Requirements
- Tests should validate the full system in realistic usage scenarios
- Tests should confirm that AI assistants can correctly discover and use components
- Performance validation should confirm response time requirements
- Tests should verify behavior across different environments

## Implementation Guidance

### AI Assistant Testing Strategy
- Implement a structured AI interaction testing framework using Playwright
- Create a controlled environment where AI assistants interact with the MCP server
- Develop a set of standardized prompts that exercise different MCP capabilities:
  - Component discovery and listing
  - Component search and filtering
  - Property inspection
  - Example usage
- Use a scoring system to evaluate AI responses for accuracy and completeness
- Record interactions for regression testing and analysis
- Define clear success criteria for each test scenario
- Include stress testing with complex, ambiguous requests

### Component Change Testing Scenarios
- Create a test suite that simulates common component changes:
  - Adding new components
  - Modifying existing component props
  - Changing component documentation
  - Removing deprecated components
  - Renaming components or properties
- Implement an automated pipeline that validates documentation accuracy after changes
- Use git hooks to trigger documentation validation on component changes
- Test incremental build scenarios with varying levels of component changes
- Validate component versioning and change tracking in documentation

### Performance Validation Methodology
- Implement a dedicated performance testing suite using k6 or similar tools
- Create baseline performance metrics for all API endpoints
- Test with varying load patterns:
  - Steady-state load testing
  - Burst traffic patterns
  - Concurrent request handling
- Measure and track key performance indicators:
  - Time to first byte
  - Total response time
  - Memory usage
  - CPU utilization
- Set up continuous performance monitoring in production
- Implement performance regression alerting
- Create visualization dashboards for performance trends

### Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing
- Use Playwright to test across multiple browsers and environments
- Create a browser matrix covering:
  - Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Mobile browsers
  - Different operating systems
- Test API consumption from various HTTP clients:
  - Browser-based fetch
  - Node.js clients
  - Python requests
  - Curl and other command-line tools
- Validate correct handling of HTTP headers and caching behavior
- Test with different network conditions and latencies
- Create automated visual regression tests for UI components
