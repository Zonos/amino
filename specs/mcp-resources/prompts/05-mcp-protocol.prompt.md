# MCP Protocol Integration Prompt

## Background
We've implemented the API routes for our documentation server. Now we need to integrate with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to make our component documentation accessible to AI assistants.

## Task Description
We need to implement the MCP protocol adapter layer to connect our API routes with MCP clients:

1. Create an MCP protocol adapter layer
2. Implement the list-components tool integration
3. Implement the find-components-by-name tool integration
4. Implement the get-component-props tool
5. Implement the get-component-examples tool

## Technical Requirements
- Full compliance with the MCP specification
- Support for all required MCP tools and formats
- Proper error handling and response formats
- Efficient mapping between our API and MCP formats
- Support for new MCP features as they evolve

## Implementation Guidance

### API to MCP Tool Mapping
- Create a dedicated adapter layer that maps MCP tool requests to existing API endpoints
- Implement direct mappings where possible:
  - list-components → GET /api/components
  - find-components-by-name → GET /api/components?search=name
  - get-component-props → GET /api/components/{name}/props
  - get-component-examples → GET /api/components/{name}/examples
- Use API composition for complex MCP requests that require multiple API calls
- Implement request parameter normalization to handle different naming conventions
- Create a consistent error mapping between API errors and MCP error responses

### MCP Request Validation
- Implement JSON Schema validation for incoming MCP requests
- Create dedicated validators for each MCP tool's parameters
- Use a middleware approach to validate requests before processing
- Provide detailed error responses that explain validation failures
- Implement rate limiting and security checks specific to MCP endpoints
- Create a logging system for invalid requests to help improve the protocol

### Documentation Format Transformation
- Create transform adapters for each component of our documentation:
  - Component metadata transformer
  - Props transformer
  - Examples transformer
  - Category transformer
- Implement a flexible mapping system that can adapt to MCP schema evolution
- Use JSON templating for systematic transformation of document structures
- Create unit tests that verify transformations match the MCP specification
- Implement a validation layer that checks output compliance with the MCP schema

### AI Assistant Optimization
- Add component relationship metadata to help assistants understand component hierarchies
- Include usage guidance specifically formatted for AI consumption
- Create "common patterns" sections in the documentation that describe typical usage
- Add prop validation rules and constraints in a machine-readable format
- Include semantic tags and categorization to improve component discovery
- Provide compatibility information and version requirements
- Include accessibility information to help assistants recommend accessible implementations

### MCP Evolution Compatibility
- Implement feature detection for MCP protocol versions
- Create adapter interfaces that can evolve without breaking existing functionality
- Use semantic versioning for our MCP implementation
- Include protocol negotiation to handle version mismatches
- Implement a feature flag system for gradual rollout of new MCP features
- Create an update strategy for keeping in sync with MCP specification changes

## Current Environment
- We have RESTful API endpoints serving component documentation
- Our documentation format is structured according to our previously defined schema
- We're using the m-yoshiro/storybook-mcp package as a reference

## Expected Outcome
Provide detailed implementation strategies for:
1. MCP protocol adapter design
2. Tool implementations for list-components, find-components-by-name, get-component-props, and get-component-examples
3. Request/response transformation for MCP compatibility
4. Error handling and edge cases

Include code examples for each MCP tool implementation and explain how to test them against MCP clients.
