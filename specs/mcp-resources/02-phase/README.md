# MCP Server Implementation - Phase 2 (Enhanced Features)

## Overview

This document outlines the Phase 2 implementation plan for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. After establishing the core functionality in Phase 1, Phase 2 focuses on enhancing the documentation quality and expanding the feature set to provide richer component information.

## Phase 2 Goals

1. Enhance the quality and depth of component documentation
2. Add TypeScript interface parsing for accurate type information
3. Improve example extraction and rendering
4. Implement search functionality
5. Enhance the organization and categorization of components

## Core Components for Phase 2

### 1. TypeScript Interface Parser

- Extract detailed type information and interfaces from component files
- Support complex TypeScript types including generics, unions, and intersections
- Process type normalization for consistent documentation
- Link types to their definitions for better navigation
- Generate detailed prop tables with accurate type information

### 2. Enhanced Example Extractor

- Extract more comprehensive examples from component files
- Support for extracting multiple examples per component
- Analyze example code to understand props usage
- Extract examples from story files in addition to JSDoc comments
- Provide context and descriptions for examples

### 3. Search Index Generator

- Generate optimized search indices for component discovery
- Index component names, descriptions, and prop information
- Support for fuzzy search and relevant result ranking
- Create specialized indices for different types of searches
- Implement efficient lookup mechanisms

### 4. Advanced JSON File Structure

- Enhance the JSON file structure with more detailed information
- Add categorization and grouping of related components
- Include cross-references between related components
- Support versioning of components and their documentation
- Optimize for efficient data retrieval

### 5. Enhanced API Endpoints

- Add search endpoint (`/api/search`)
- Implement category-based component listing (`/api/categories/:category/components`)
- Add support for filtering and pagination
- Enhance component details with more comprehensive information

## Implementation Sequence

1. Develop the TypeScript interface parser
2. Enhance the example extraction capabilities
3. Implement the search index generator
4. Create the advanced JSON file organization
5. Expand the API endpoints
6. Update the MCP protocol tool implementations
7. Add comprehensive testing for all new features

## Integration with Phase 1

Phase 2 builds on the foundation established in Phase 1:

1. The component discovery module will be reused
2. The JSDoc extractor will be enhanced rather than replaced
3. The basic API endpoints will be extended
4. The build integration will be maintained with additional capabilities
5. Error handling and logging will be enhanced

## Success Criteria

The Phase 2 implementation will be considered successful when:

1. TypeScript interfaces are accurately extracted and documented
2. Examples are comprehensively extracted from both JSDoc and story files
3. Search functionality provides relevant and accurate results
4. Components are properly categorized and organized
5. The API provides rich, detailed component information
6. The MCP protocol tools support enhanced capabilities

## Features Deferred to Phase 3

1. Advanced performance optimizations and caching strategies
2. Production deployment configurations
3. Comprehensive monitoring and analytics
4. Advanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Integration with external documentation systems

## Next Steps After Phase 2

After completing Phase 2, we will evaluate the enhanced implementation and plan for Phase 3, which will focus on production readiness, performance optimization, and advanced features for enterprise-grade deployment.
