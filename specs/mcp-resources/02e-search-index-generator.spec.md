# Search Index Generator Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our strategy for creating an efficient search index for component documentation in the MCP server implementation. The search index generator will produce optimized data structures that enable fast, relevant search across component metadata, props, and examples.

## Approach

We will implement a dedicated search index generator that processes component documentation and creates specialized indices for different search scenarios. This component will focus on producing compact, efficient search indices that support the performance requirements of the MCP server.

## Implementation Strategy

Our implementation will focus on creating a customized inverted index structure optimized for component documentation using the following approach:

1. **Text Processing**: Implement tokenization, normalization, and indexing of component text content.

2. **Field-Specific Indexing**: Create specialized indices for component names, descriptions, props, and examples.

3. **Relevance Scoring**: Implement a scoring system that prioritizes matches based on field importance.

4. **Search Optimization**: Support prefix matching, fuzzy matching, and exact matching with appropriate optimizations.

5. **Index Serialization**: Create compact, serialized representations of search indices.

## Core Components

### 1. Text Processing Module

This module will handle text normalization and tokenization:

- Implement tokenization for component text fields
- Apply text normalization (lowercase, stemming, etc.)
- Handle special cases like camelCase and kebab-case identifiers
- Generate n-grams for substring matching
- Remove stop words specific to component documentation

### 2. Indexing Module

This module will build the search index structures:

- Create inverted indices mapping terms to components
- Build specialized indices for different field types
- Implement prefix trie structures for autocomplete
- Generate field-specific indices (names, props, descriptions)
- Include metadata for relevance scoring

### 3. Scoring Module

This module will implement relevance scoring for search results:

- Define field weights (names > props > descriptions)
- Implement TF-IDF based scoring
- Add position-based relevance factors
- Include exact match bonuses
- Support recency factors for newer components

### 4. Search Query Processing

This module will handle search query execution:

- Parse and normalize search queries
- Execute multi-stage search pipeline
- Handle prefix and fuzzy matching
- Apply relevance scoring
- Return ranked results

### 5. Index Serialization

This module will handle conversion to JSON-serializable format:

- Create optimized representation of indices
- Compress index structures where possible
- Format indices for efficient client-side use
- Structure output for incremental loading

## Search Features

The search index will support the following search features:

1. **Component Name Search**: High-precision matching on component names
2. **Prop Name Search**: Finding components by their prop names
3. **Description Search**: Full-text search in component descriptions
4. **Tag and Category Search**: Finding components by tags or categories
5. **Example Code Search**: Searching within component example code
6. **Prefix Matching**: Support for partial word searches (auto-complete)
7. **Fuzzy Matching**: Tolerance for typos and spelling variations

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal search performance:

1. **Index Size Optimization**: Minimize index size for quick loading
2. **Search Execution Speed**: Optimize for <10ms search execution time
3. **Memory Usage**: Balance between performance and memory consumption
4. **Incremental Updates**: Support for updating only changed components

## Integration with Documentation Pipeline

The search index generator will integrate with the broader documentation pipeline as follows:

1. After component documentation is extracted and processed, the search index generator receives the aggregated documentation
2. The generator creates optimized search indices from this documentation
3. The indices are serialized as part of the documentation output
4. The MCP server uses these indices for search functionality

## Search Algorithm Selection

We'll implement a multi-stage search algorithm:

1. **Stage 1**: Exact matches on component names
2. **Stage 2**: Prefix matches on component names
3. **Stage 3**: Exact matches on prop names and tags
4. **Stage 4**: Full-text matches on descriptions
5. **Stage 5**: Fuzzy matches as fallback

## Next Steps

1. Implement the text processing module in `build-utils/mcp/generators/search-text-processor.ts`
2. Create the indexing module for building search indices
3. Implement the scoring system for relevance ranking
4. Develop the serialization format for efficient storage
5. Create test suite with various search scenarios
